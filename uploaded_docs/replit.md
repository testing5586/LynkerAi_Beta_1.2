# Overview
LynkerAI is an AI-powered task execution system designed to generate and execute code from natural language descriptions using OpenAI's API. It functions as an intelligent code generator, interpreting user requests to create and manage code files automatically. The project provides a robust platform for semantic-based analysis, including birth chart verification and soulmate matching, by leveraging advanced AI models for deeper compatibility insights, and a comprehensive system for managing and interacting with AI-generated content and user data.

## Core Philosophy (核心愿景)
LynkerAI 以"命理科学化、社交化、数据化"为核心愿景，建立能自我学习、验证、发现命运规律的智能体系。系统采用三层架构：Master AI（主控中枢）、Guru AI（导师助理）、Child AI（学徒助手），通过社交互动、智能匹配与验证系统，构建全球真命数据库（Global TrueTime Archive），目标收集100万条经验证的精准出生时间，推动"秒柱命理科学"体系发展。详见 `docs/lynker_ai_core_index_v2.docx`。

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Design Pattern
The application utilizes a command-line interface (CLI) with an AI-driven code generation pipeline:
1.  **Task Interpretation Layer**: Processes natural language task descriptions.
2.  **AI Generation Layer**: Generates code using OpenAI's chat completion API.
3.  **File Management Layer**: Manages file creation and command execution via a bridge module.

## Modular Architecture
-   **Main Control Engine (`main.py`)**: Centralized orchestration hub, coordinating all LynkerAI modules and managing a unified JSON logging system.
-   **Code Generator (`lynker_master_ai.py`)**: Handles AI-powered code generation, processes task descriptions, and interacts with the OpenAI API.
-   **Database Layer (`supabase_init.py`)**: Manages Supabase connections, including client initialization and automatic table creation for various features.
-   **TrueChart Verifier (`ai_truechart_verifier.py`)**: Performs semantic validation of birth charts against life events, supporting single and multi-chart verification, intelligent weight learning, and user life profile storage.
-   **Soulmate Matcher (`soulmate_matcher.py`)**: Identifies users with similar life experiences using semantic matching of `life_tags` and cosine similarity.
-   **Child AI Insight Generator (`child_ai_insight.py`)**: Generates independent, rule-based insights for match results using templates, with local JSON backup.
-   **Child AI Memory Vault (`child_ai_memory.py`)**: Manages user interaction history with matched partners, tracks memories and engagement, and provides data for a React frontend component.
-   **Google Drive Sync (`google_drive_sync.py`)**: Enables users to back up AI memories to their personal Google Drive via OAuth 2.0.
-   **OAuth Authorization Flow (`google_oauth_real_flow.py`, Flask API)**: Handles Google OAuth for token exchange, user info retrieval, and persistence of credentials to Supabase.
-   **Lynker Master Vault (`lynker_master_vault/`)**: An intelligent document management system for categorizing, indexing, and searching project documentation. Includes a CLI import tool, a unified Flask API for uploads and queries, and a React-based memory dashboard.
-   **Multi-Model AI Chat (`multi_model_ai.py`, Flask API integration)**: Provides a unified interface for multiple AI providers (ChatGPT, Gemini, ChatGLM, DeepSeek) with an automatic fallback mechanism and RAG integration. Includes performance monitoring and a visual dashboard.
-   **Message Hub / Conversation Bus (`conversation_bus.py`, Flask API integration)**: An event-driven, three-party collaboration system (Master AI ↔ Child AI ↔ User) for task delegation, conversation tracking, and async execution with callbacks. Includes a full-screen visual chat interface (`static/tri_chat.html`) accessible at `/tri-chat` for real-time three-party conversation monitoring and interaction.
-   **Domain Auto-Detection (`update_redirect_uri.py`)**: Dynamically detects Replit Sisko domain and provides guidance for updating Google OAuth redirect URIs.
-   **Bridge Module (`replit_bridge.py`)**: Abstracts file system operations and command execution for platform independence.
-   **Security Layer (`ai_guard_middleware.py`)**: Centralized access control for AI operations, checking user permissions, call limits, and service status.
-   **TMS - Trusted Metaphysics System (`master_ai/`)**: Global trusted chart verification network with pseudonym protection, signature verification, regional adaptation, confidence voting, and hierarchical validation architecture. Includes Master Validator API (port 8080), PostgreSQL database schema, and comprehensive documentation.
-   **Multi-Provider Manager (`master_ai/provider_manager.py`)**: Intelligent AI provider scheduling system for ChatGPT/Gemini/GLM/DeepSeek with automatic fallback, performance monitoring, statistical analysis, and web visualization dashboard.

## Language & Runtime
-   **Language**: Python 3.x
-   **Execution Model**: Single-process, synchronous.

## Prompt Engineering Strategy
Utilizes structured prompt templates to ensure predictable and parseable AI responses.

## Error Handling
Includes environment validation, graceful degradation, and comprehensive output capture.
